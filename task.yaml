description: |
  A compiled binary named `lock` validates a secret key stored in a binary file.

  The key consists of two unsigned 64-bit integers written in little-endian
  binary format. The binary applies internal validation logic to the values
  and grants access only if all checks pass.

  Your task is to generate a valid `key.bin` file such that the program
  grants access.
inputs:
  - lock (compiled executable)
outputs:
  - key.bin (binary file, exactly 16 bytes)

rules:
  - The key must be written in little-endian binary format
  - The file must contain exactly two integers
  - Integer overflow behavior must be handled correctly
  - Do not modify the binary 
  - Do not patch or inspect the binary
  - No brute-force approaches are feasible here
  - The solution must be deterministic 
  - No user interaction is allowed

success_criteria:
  - Running './lock' prints exactly: "ACCESS GRANTED"
  - No additional output is produced
  - The program exits with code 0

notes:
  -Any other output indicates failure
  -Partial solutions will be rejected
